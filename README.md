## About This Project
This project is created as part of the **Software QA Engineer Assessment** for **Netizen eXperience**.  
The goal of the assignment is to build a simple cat preference web application, then evaluate it using QA methodologies.

To focus on **quality assurance**, the application is intentionally kept simple using:

- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**  
- **Cataas API**  

Swiping interactions were **not implemented by design** to prioritize:

- Functional testing  
- UX evaluation  
- Documentation  
- Error/edge case analysis  

This allowed deeper demonstration of actual QA skills.
